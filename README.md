# Docker Environment for the development on the Rasberry Pico

## Repository Structure:
    - Dockerfile: The docker file to build the ubuntu image for the development environment
    - pico_setup.sh: The bash script taken from the Rasberry Pico W starter guide (Will be linked later)

NOTE: This image has a bug in it. This is an initial commit because I am tired right now and I need a break
